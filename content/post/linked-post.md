***Abstract***

In this paper, we use the formalism of Clifford algebras to
extend the so-called Monogenic Signal to color images. This extension
consists in a function with values in the Clifford algebra R5,0 that encodes color as well as geometric structure information. Using geometric
calculus, such a mathematical object can be used to extend classical concepts of signal processing (filtering, Fourier Transform...) to color images in a consistent manner. Regarding this paper, a local color phase is introduced, which generalizes the one for grayscale image. As an example
of application, we provide a new method for color segmentation. Based
on our phase definition and the multiscale aspect of the Color Monogenic
Signal, we provide a metric approach using differential geometry which
reveals relevant on the Berkeley Image Dataset
